        <p> Captain Kirk has been in the NFL since 2012, taking over at helm for the Vikings in 2018. Cousins has been a solid to later quality QB in Fantasy Football. </p>
        <p> However, two important changes have upped his potential. The first being Coach Kevin O'Connell, who served as the Rams OC, where his offense went on to win the SuperBowl. O'Connell features a more pass-happy offense, which works perfectly with the second change in Justin Jefferson. </p>
        <p> Jefferson has had no issues establishing himself as the Vikings WR1, breaking records as a rookie. Paired with O'Connell and Jefferson, Cousins is staffed with an elite supporting cast, allowing him to sling touchdowns and further up his PPR value.</p>
