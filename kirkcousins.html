      <p> Cooks, drafted in 2014, has played on several teams, inclduing the Saints, Patriots, Rams, and currently the Texans. </p>
      <p> Especially with second year QB Davis Mills at helm, Cooks provides an ol reliable target. In addition, Cooks hit 1000 yards in 6 of his past 7 seasons.</p>
      <p> He is the true WR 1 of Houston who sees an offense that needs retooling.</p>
