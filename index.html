<h1> David's three sleeper picks for Fantasy Football </h1>


<p> Hello! Attached are my top 3 sleeper fantasy picks for this upcoming year. These are players I have drafted or wish I did</p>
<p> Ah Fantasy Football. It can almost be a bit like investing. Doing hours of research on who's projected to boom or bust. 
  Taking into consideration team situations, chemistry issues, the murmurs of offseason. And finally, taking the bets on who's going to come up big. Who's going to falter in the big moments. I think in most leagues, the order of the top round has already been set. Here's who I believe is legitimately slept on for this season.  </p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Team</th>
    <th>Player</th>
    <th>Position</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td> Houston Texans</td>
    <td> Brandin Cooks</td>
    <td> Wide Receiver</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Green Bay Packers</td>
    <td> Romeo Doubs</td>
    <td> Wide Receiver</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Minnesota Vikings</td>
    <td> Kirk Cousins</td>
    <td> Quarterback</td>
  </tr>
